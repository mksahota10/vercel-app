        When considering the optimal approach for deploying applications on Vercel, deciding between Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware depends on the specific requirements and goals of your project. The keyword "flexibility" becomes crucial when making this decision. If you prioritize granular control over the edge logic while leveraging Vercel's global network to enhance performance, Edge Functions would be an excellent choice. With Edge Functions, you can execute custom JavaScript code at the edge locations closest to users, enabling real-time responses and personalized content delivery. On the other hand, if your application demands dynamic server-side functionality without worrying about scaling concerns or infrastructure management, utilizing Serverless Functions is recommended. This option allows developers to focus solely on writing functions that run in response to HTTP requests while benefiting from automatic scaling and high availability provided by Vercel's serverless infrastructure. Lastly, if you aim to modify incoming requests or outgoing responses based on predefined rules before reaching your application code, employing Edge Middleware proves beneficial. By implementing middleware scripts at Vercel's edge network globally distributed points-of-presence (PoPs), you can perform operations like authorization checks or request transformations efficiently and securely while ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and geographic regions.
        The Edge Functions are used when you need to interact with data over the network as fast as possible, such as executing OAuth callbacks or responding to webhook requests.
        A serverless function is suitable for general-purpose backend logic, API endpoints, and other computation tasks that do not require Edge Functions' specific benefits. 
        Using Edge Middleware, a site's response can be modified based on the incoming request before it is processed. Before returning a response, it can execute custom logic, rewrite, redirect, add headers, and more to provide personalization to statically generated content.
