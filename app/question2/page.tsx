        When comparing Next.js with another popular framework like React, it becomes apparent that both platforms offer powerful features for building dynamic web applications. However, one standout advantage of Next.js is its exceptional server-side rendering capabilities. By leveraging its built-in routing system and pre-rendering pages during build time, the keyword "Next.js" enables developers to create highly optimized websites that load quickly and efficiently. Additionally, with Next.js's automatic code splitting feature, only the necessary JavaScript bundles are loaded when navigating between pages, resulting in enhanced performance and improved user experience. While React also provides a solid foundation for front-end development with its component-based architecture, it requires additional configuration and third-party libraries to achieve similar server-side rendering capabilities as those offered by Next.js out-of-the-box. In conclusion, Next.js stands apart from other frameworks due to its seamless integration of server-side rendering functionality while still maintaining all the benefits of working with React components.
